The SRS project on github is closed. This is the latest code forked, and no major updates
are expected from the original writer. So although the output contains a warning about being
unstable and suggests us to use the 1.0 stable release, we think it might be a good idea to
start with this 2.0 branch. There's also a development branch which heads towards 3.0, but that
is a bit too much for us (at least 2.0 had few alphas).

In any case, because we don't need any particular feature from the 2.0 branch (or do we?),
if it happens that there's a major problem with it, we can always switch back to the 1.0 stable
branch effortlessly.
